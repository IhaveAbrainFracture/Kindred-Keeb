i more or less spent this day just brainstorming what i was going to do because i knew i was going to make a custom keyboard for my gf but i didnt know what to theme it off of ect i came to the following conclusions after a hour of brainstorming
 - the keyboard is going to be based on a game preferably one with chatecters so i can theme it off her "main"
 - options include: Kindred, Cypher, kai'sa, The Engineneer and Clove
 - i want the pcb to be as good as possible so i can use it for myself later
 - most likely going to use tactile switches
 - i want it to be hot swappable
 - i should make accessories that add on to the keeb (arm rest)

   ill put photos here late but this day mostly consisted of research and making the schematics/pcb ill pop photos in the morning but more or less i have a terrible time trying to position and align everything, ultimatly i did get most of the pcb and schematics done. (funny note, i spent 1h just on messing with footprints) either way i think i ended this day with the matrix wired in the pcb and the footprints more or less is the right spot but nothing was connected to the pico and i still had to run through the 20 drc issues
