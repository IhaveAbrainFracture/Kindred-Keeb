total hours ~ 45  (these hours are like not locked in locked in hours cos i was very non strict in time in reality this project could be done in 30h)

# background information that you may want to know to that some things make more sense
- kindred is a league of legends charecter who lore wise in just death
- the idea is when someone is about to die they can choose to me killed swiftly by lamb's bow or resist dead and fight wolf in more or less a bloodbath
- in the game one of her core mechanics is the mark of the hunted which is a big target sign
- in lol after picking a charecter you pick runes which slightly modify a charecter
- kindred is a top tier meta pick rn trust

# mildly important note
** So im updating the journal to reflect what ive done anything with "OLD:" is the old entry which i kept because its a little more authentic as it was done on the day (most likely at 12 or 1 AM) but for all non troll reasons read the new entry since its a better explainantion on what i did and how that went **

 OLD: so i've been procrastinating making and updating the journal for the first few days because just like today (15/07/25) ive staid up till 12pm to work on stuff either way ill recap the last 2 days which had me working on electronics (PCB)

# 13/07/25 2h
Old : i more or less spent this day just brainstorming what i was going to do because i knew i was going to make a custom keyboard for my gf but i didnt know what to theme it off of ect i came to the following conclusions after a hour of brainstorming
 - the keyboard is going to be based on a game preferably one with chatecters so i can theme it off her "main"
 - options include: Kindred, Cypher, kai'sa, The Engineneer and Clove
 - i want the pcb to be as good as possible so i can use it for myself later
 - most likely going to use tactile switches
 - i want it to be hot swappable
 - i should make accessories that add on to the keeb (arm rest)
   
New: 

this day was spent brainstorming the main take aways was that i knew the keeb (keyboard) was going to be based on a charecter from a game most likely league of legends or valorant ( in ended up being kindred from lol altho it was very close to being based on clove, the color profiles are below). Further more i knew i wanted the PCB to be good enough that it could be used in future projects meaning i wanted it to be versitile and high quality ie hot swappable and good layout

Above is the colour profile for clove

Above is the colour proflie for kindred

Theme wise i also had 2 options the duality, yin yang-ish theme or the butterflys and repetion theme (these being from kindred and clove respectfully)\
ultimatly i picked kindred cos ann (nickname) play way more lol then valo also i though it would be easier to design (i was wrong)

here were the broad design choices after deciding to base the keeb of kindred
- case divided into 2 parts (wolf and Lamb)
- 2 diffrent switchs one that heavy and loud/thocky and one thats light and silent
- the masks need to be somewhere, and the cool quotes
- it would be nice to have the keeb textured
- the mark of the hunted needs to be everywhere on keycaps and case


# 14/07/25 16h
  OLD: ill put photos here late but this day mostly consisted of research and making the schematics/pcb ill pop photos in the morning but more or less i have a terrible time trying to position and align everything, ultimatly i did get most of the pcb and schematics done. (funny note, i spent 1h just on messing with footprints) either way i think i ended this day with the matrix wired in the pcb and the footprints more or less is the right spot but nothing was connected to the pico and i still had to run through the 20 drc issues  also cleaned up the pcb specifically wiring everything to the pico, drc, and silk screen( i added so many easter eggs) i also posted the pcb to the atlier discord server for feedback and implemented that

New:
Started PCB it was mostly easy the core concepts are the same, im also hyper gratfull that i learnt how to wire matrixes and stuff early,


Schematic here:

- <img width="400" height="499" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56c484aa-ab83-4f95-87df-0f59fd396828" /> <img width="400" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d376f9-6cc1-4e7f-acc6-4e3b0e31c1a7" />
(fun fact you can make a seperate sheet for your schematic using "s" , thats were my matrix is)
I also experimented with the idea of leds but i just couldnt figure a way to make it fit the theme heres that schematic either way

- <img width="624" height="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b266da06-f2f9-42e9-8a8e-82232dbff8b9" />
i also got most of the keyboard pcb done which looks like this
- <img width="1171" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9a148b-06d9-4d80-86b0-a4d7a26745fb" />
you also might notice the fact that col 15 isnt connected in the matrix above and ye i just fixed that (18/07/25) 
with silk it looks like this
- <img width="1127" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e699c152-b3a2-4796-9ac0-fd6778225b30" />
- Explaination of silk (she loves cats, use to main cypher in valorant hence the abilitys in the corners, currently is training in kendo, and the kindred mask exists)
i also put stuff into the atelier discord for review and implemented that feedback.( to anyone who wants to also make a keyboard my suggestion is to pick the ai03 footprints and stick to them)

  # 15/07/25 10h

  # 16/07/25 5h
  OLD: trust me i did stuff but this is another i stayed up till 12 situation so ill update this later the tldr is the base of the case is more or less done its just design stuff lef

 OLD:  this entry got deleted so like gotta add stuff
New: so this carries on to the next entry since i wrote 18 cos it was 1 am either way this day i finished all is not most of the design/cosmetic stuff best shown though photos, ill also be explaining some of the cool things


<img width="705" height="610" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c18e926-b9b5-490f-b066-60ef65736b4c" />

- so this is the mark of the hunted and i wanted it to be a core part of the case so its in the center and the middle

- <img width="880" height="357" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-18 214510" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1048ddb9-79fa-4662-a8b6-86ae2b3d4c8a" />

- so this is a mix of wolfs and lambs mask with one of their most common voicelines "never one without the other" its also black and white to reflect the duality theme i started with
